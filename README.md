# `blurred`
A fast image blur, based on [Stack
Blur](http://incubator.quasimondo.com/processing/fast_blur_deluxe.php). It
works directly on buffers, so can equally be used on the front and the
back end.

Get it:

    npm install -s blurred
    
## Gist
Basic usage:

```js
import blur from 'blurred';

let buffer;
/*
 * Do something to initialise the image buffer.
 * Suppose the image buffer has width 1024, height 768.
 */

// blur the image with blur radius 12
const width = 1024;
const height = 768;
const blurRadius = 12;
blur(buffer, blurRadius, width, height);
```

Some convenience methods are provided in the browser:

```js
import { blurCanvas, blurImage, blurURL } from 'blurred/util';

const blurRadius = 14;
// Blur an image located at a URL
blurURL('http://someurl', blurRadius)
  .then(image => {
    // do something with the image -- the argumant is an HTMLImageElement
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log('Error loading or blurring image.');
  });

// Blur an image located at a url, and set the document body background
// image to the result.
// For this, pass a second argument 'url'.
blurURL('http://someurl', blurRadius, 'url')
  .then(url => {
    document.body.style.backgroundImage = `url(${url})`;
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log('Error loading or blurring image.');
  });

// Blur an ImageElement in place
blurImage(someImageElement, blurRadius);

// Blur a region in a canvas in place.
const x = 12;
const y = 30;
const width = 46;
const height = 12;
blurCanvas(someCanvas, blurRadius, x, y, width, height);
```

## `blurred` API

### `blur(pixels: Uint8ClampedArray, radius: number, width: number, height: number): Uint8ClampedArray`
Blurs a buffer. Pixels are assumed four bytes long: three colour bytes
and an alpha channel. The alpha channel is ignored in the blur. All
number parameters must be integers, and the height is optional.

## `blurred/util` â€“ convenience functions in the browser
Some sugar around the basic blur.

### `blurCanvas(canvas: HTMLCanvasElement, radius: number, x, y, width: number, height: number): void`
Blurs a rectangle in a canvas. The dimensions default to the size of
the canvas.

### `blurImage(img: HTMLImageElement, radius: number, asImmutable?: boolean): HTMLImageElemen`
Blurs an image. By default does so in place, but if the asImmutable
option is set to true it does not modify the original. Returns the
blurred image.

### `blurURL(url: string, radius: number, asDataURL?: boolean): Promise<HTMLImageElement|string>`
Blurs an image at a given URL. Returns a promise that resolves to the
blurred image, or a dataURL for that image, depending on whether the
`asDataURL` flag is true.

## Typescript
Everything is typed.

## Changelog

 - 1.0.1 : very small bug fix. Blur height is calculated correctly.
 - 2.0.0 : API changes: all browser utilities are now in
   `blurred/util`. `lib` no longer exists. The basic `blur` function
   should be required directly from the package. See examples.
    
   Numerous typos in the documentation
   fixed. https://github.com/idokutela/blurred/pull/1
   incorporated. The tsconfig was simplified, as was the packaging.
